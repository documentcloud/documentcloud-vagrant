# DocumentCloud Vagrant VM

These Vagrant scripts provide a(n ALPHA-STAGE) development environment for the DocumentCloud platform.  [DocumentCloud](http://www.documentcloud.org) itself is a web based platform for uploading, analyzing, annotating and publishing primary source material.

Vagrant will execute the [runner script](documentcloud-vagrant/blob/master/scripts/runner) script to provision the box.

The script has several variables that can be modified at the top, such as the user login and password to create.
